Frontend:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap for responsive design
- jQuery for AJAX calls

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
---------------------

PHASE 1: Setup & Database
1. Create project structure
2. Setup SQLite database with tables
3. Create database models and connections

PHASE 2: Patient & Appointment Module
4. Create patient registration and login pages
5. Build appointment booking form
6. Implement appointment scheduling logic
7. Create dashboard for patients

PHASE 3: Zoom Integration
8. Setup Zoom API credentials
9. Implement meeting creation function
10. Send meeting links to patients

PHASE 4: Payment Integration
11. Integrate payment gateway
12. Create payment processing flow
13. Implement payment confirmation
14. Generate invoices/receipts

PHASE 5: Admin & Testing
15. Create admin panel
16. Test all functionalities
17. Deploy the application

FILES TO CREATE:
----------------
1. app.py (main Flask application)
2. database.py (database setup and models)
3. models.py (data models)
4. config.py (configuration settings)
5. requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
6. templates/
   - index.html (home page)
   - register.html (patient registration)

10. email_service.py (Email notifications)

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
------------------------
- Hash passwords using bcrypt
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement CSRF protection
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Secure payment processing
- Session management

DEPLOYMENT:
-----------
- Can be deployed on Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, or local server
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Setup proper database backups

ESTIMATED TIMELINE:
-------------------
- Phase 1: 1-2 days
- Phase 2: 2-3 days
- Phase 3: 1-2 days
- Phase 4: 2-3 days
- Phase 5: 1-2 days
Total: 7-12 days (depending on complexity and customization)

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Get Zoom API credentials (https://marketplace.zoom.us/)
2. Choose payment gateway and get API keys
3. Start implementing Phase 1
4. Test each module before moving to next phase
