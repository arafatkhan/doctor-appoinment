üìä NEW HOURLY APPOINTMENT LIMIT FEATURE
=======================================

‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
- Maximum 20 appointments per doctor per hour
- Automatic validation on booking form
- Hourly status display on doctor dashboard
- Color-coded status indicators:
  * GREEN: Available (0-14 appointments)
  * YELLOW: Almost Full (15-19 appointments) 
  * RED: FULL (20 appointments)

‚ö†Ô∏è HOW IT WORKS:
1. When patient books appointment, system checks hourly limit
2. If 20 appointments already booked for that hour, shows error:
   "‡¶°‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞ [Name] ‡¶è‡¶∞ [Time] ‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßá ‡¶á‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶Æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßá 20‡¶ü‡¶ø appointment ‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶ï ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá ‡¶ó‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá‡•§ ‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶®‡•§"
3. Doctor dashboard shows real-time hourly statistics
4. Example: 2 hours = 40 total appointments maximum
